Simple steps for creating Debian package
------------------------------------------
Debian packages must adhere to a strict directory structure. 
This includes a so-called control file and other scripts that 
look after what happens during installation of the package

The control file, DEBIAN/control
------------------------------------
The control file is the core of the Debian package; it contains all 
relevant metadata. Things such as package name, version, supported 
architectures, and dependancies are all included in this file. 

Here is what our current control file looks like:

Package: sd-agent
Version: 1.4.2
Architecture: all
Essential: no
Section: web
Priority: optional
Depends: python (>=2.3)
Maintainer: Ryan Duffield
Installed-Size: 96
Description: The Server Density monitoring agent.


The conffiles, DEBIAN/conffiles
-----------------------------------------
Configuration files, or “conffiles”, are files that are included 
within a Debian package that may be changed by a user. When uninstalling 
the package, a user or system administrator dealing with the package may 
not want his or her configuration files removed. 
Running sudo apt-get remove sd-agent will remove all installed package files 
except for those listed in the DEBIAN/conffiles file. 

Here is what ours looks like:

/etc/sd-agent/config.cfg
/etc/init.d/sd-agent

If a user truly wants to remove everything including the configuration files, 
this can be done by using the purge command instead of remove: 
sudo apt-get purge sd-agent.

The md5sums file (DEBIAN/md5sums)
----------------------------------------

This file is a list of MD5 checksums for all files contained within the package 
that will actually be extracted to the system. This can be most easily generated 
using a combination of commands:

$ find . -type f ! -regex '.*.hg.*' ! -regex '.*?debian-binary.*' ! -regex '.*?DEBIAN.*' -print0 | xargs --null md5sum > DEBIAN/md5sums

Creating the package
------------------------------------------

When all of the above is in place, creating the actual Debian package, or .deb file, is easy:

$ dpkg -b pkg-debian/ sd-agent_1.4.2_i386.deb
$ dpkg-deb: building package sd-agent' insd-agent_1.4.2_i386.deb'.


----------------------
Summary
-----------------------

1) dpkg -b package-folder package-name.deb
   where folder-name will have some important files in a
   structured way.

   It should have
   package-folder
   --> DEBIAN/control file
   --> DEBIAN/md5sums file
   --> /etc/configuration-files (optional)
   --> /usr/bin/some-more-files (optional)

2) To see details of a package
   dpkg --info package-name
3) To install Package
   dpkg --install package-name
4) To check whether a package installed or not
   dpkg -L package-name
